# Clouds Laboratories

This repository contains my work for the Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems
exam at EURECOM.

The repository contains three Jupyer Notebook showing how I implemented and analyzed
the gradient descent and k-means algorithms using the Spark framework. Moreover,
the `SPARSQL.ipynb` notebook shows how I analyzed a dataset containing information
about the flights occurred in the USA during the year 1994 using SparkSQL.
